## Romanisation and Pronunciation

There are two very common ways to romanise Chinese: Pinyin and Wade-Giles. Both systems have their strengths and weaknesses, but Wide-Giles is very much in decline with the strong support given Pinyin by its its recognition by the People's Republic of China as the official romanisation method. I prefer pinyin myself, mostly because I have been using it the longest. However, the older Wade-Giles romanisation system is still found in many of the older publications that you have been assigned in this class. 

I would prefer that you use pinyin in your writing for this class, and convert Wade-Giles, when necessary, to pinyin, except in the case of the names of Chiang Kai-shek and Sun Yat-sen. 

To make this easier, consider using one of these resources:

When it comes to pronouncing Chinese, there are a number of good videos on Youtube and on various websites online. I encourage you to give it a try and watch some of these videos or listen to the audio available on a number of online sites. Spending a few minutes of work a few times during the semester you should be able to learn the main sounds in Chinese, even if you will not be able to master the rules for tones.  While obviously, this is not assessed in this history course, but I hope you will find this rewarding, as the we see Chinese names, terms, and hear ever more about China in our daily lives.

A few particularly troublesome sounds when trying to pronounce words in pinyin:

* X = close to "sh" as in "sheep"
* ZH = close to "j" as in "jam"
* C = "ts" as in "bits"
* Q = "ch" as in "chips"
* Z = "ds" in "woods"
* YI = "ee" as in "sheep"
* I = "ee" as in "sheep"
* E = the vowel part of "ughh" when someone punches you hard in the stomach
* Ü = start saying "ee", then close your mouth as if you are blowing out a candle. As in "ou" in Scottish "You!" or German ü
* Shi, Zhi, Chi = "ure" sound as in Sure, (Jer)sey, and (Chur)n
