# Seminars

**Please Note**: We have an online reading list for the module for your convenience but it is harder to read, is sometimes missing texts, and does not include specific tasks that I set for your preparation. Please make sure that you always work from this handbook as you prepare your readings but you can check for ebook versions etc. with the digital reading list. 

*Again*: this handbook is the canonical version of your preparation guidelines. Please work from this handbook as you review readings for the week ahead.

P = Text is a candidate for presentations

## Week 1 - Introductions and Overview

### Required Reading

I will be emailing prospective students prior to the start of the semester (over the summer when this module is taught during the fall) and encourage you to have come to class having read the chapters related to East Asian historiography in *The Oxford History of Historical Writing* series. We have ebook access to these through the library. Please read the chapters below (about 550 pages including bibliographies) as all of these contain many possibilities for your long essay beyond what is covered in seminar themes, but if you are not able to find time for them all, then please focus on those with a "\*\*" after the title, most of all, and thereafter those with "\*".

### Elective Reading

For your elective reading handout, please select one of the chapters of the Oxford History that interests you.

### Further Reading

Since you should be focusing on research for your long essay throughout the semester, you are not required to do any particular further reading on any given week. However, this section in each week will be useful for you as you think about the topic for your long essay and provide you with additional sources that can serve as the starting place for your research.

This module assumes that you have read extensively on historiography in your HI2001 module. You may want to refresh you memory or deepen your engagement with the broader debates in historiography with the following texts, which will also often be good starting points for the theoretical engagement of your essays.

### Preparation

1. The East Asia related chapters of the *Oxford History* are written by many of the key authors writing on historiography for the region in the English language. We will meet many of these authors again in future weeks. If you read these chapters well, which almost all have great suggestions for further reading, and engage with a wide range of scholarship through the footnotes, they should provide you with a few early ideas for your long essay project. Please come to the seminar having reflected on this reading not only for understanding, but ask yourself what issues, time period, texts, or historians spark your interest for possible long essay directions. Make note of the some of the suggested readings from the chapters that most interest you.

2. Scan over the list of texts at the end of this handbook and make a list of books that are in your topics of interest. Check on their online availability through the university library, or if necessary, their availability for purchase if you think they will be of central importance to your project.

### Preparation

Continue to reserve some time to think about your long essay for the semester. Look ahead to readings in future weeks and try to read at least an article or chapter related to a potential essay topic.

### Long Essay Ideas

There are no shortage of ways to engage with the Spring and Autumn annals and its Zuozhuan or Gongyang commentaries. However, there are other texts from this or before this time we didn't focus on that are deeply interesting to explore: the Book of History, or the Book of Documents as it is sometimes called; The Odes (used as history or in history); and the Legends of the Warring States.

### Preparation

Now that your prospectus for your long essay has been submitted, deepen your reading around your essay. Consider having done one or two of your blog entries by this week. It makes sense to get them out of the way earlier in the semester so you don't become overwhelmed as the long essay deadline approaches.

### Preparation

You should be getting your prospectus feedback this week. Think ahead about how you will be using the independent learning week to make progress on the long essay. Are any inter-library loan books you need already requested? 

## Week 6 Independent Learning Week

If you didn't get a chance to read or take notes on the Oxford history before the semester began, consider catching up on those, especially the chapters from volume three onward. 

This is the week when you should make the most progress on your research for your long essay. You have dedicated time this week, without the distraction of other reading assignments. After this week you should begin the process of writing the long essay.

## Week 7 - Martial Tales and History: The Romance of the Three Kingdoms and The Tale of the Heike

In most years students will have a collective choice on which of these two key texts to focus on for seminar discussion. Due to limits on library access, and the need to prepare online texts over the summer, Fall 2020 will focus on the historical novel attributed to Luo Guanzhong, *The Three Kingdoms*.

### Preparation

As you prepare for class, think about the ways in which fictional or rather  fictionalised works that recount the past play a disproportionately large importance in terms of how many think about what transpired historically. 

Consider beginning the writing process for your long essay. Are there easy sections you already have the material ready for that you can get out of the way? Is the historiographical background something you can get started with?

### Preparation

I would suggest that you finish up your blog entries early so you can dedicate your time to tutorial preparation and the long essay at this point without distraction. 

As you read for this week, ask yourself how some of the processes discussed in these readings are distinctive or share features with other transitions in historical writing during the emergence of modern states.

### Preparation

Many of the elective readings for this week are related to textbooks. What are some of the distinctive features of history textbooks, if any?

## Starting Points for Long Essay Research
