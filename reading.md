# Tutorial Preparation

**Reading**

This module, which has no final exam, is designed to provide you flexibility in your learning, while also providing themes that enable us to have rich seminar discussion. It is important that you come to tutorial well prepared as you will be expected to know the materials well. Your preparation for each week will require the usual 15-20 hours of work, and I suggest you **divide the preparation time across three days**. Your reading and research preparation each week is comprised of:

1) Core readings that all students are required to read. (3-8 hours)
2) Additional **required** 'elective' reading that is selected by the student from several options provided. You must choose one category of readings to prepare and this is the material you focus on for elective reading handouts. (3-8 hours)
3) Each week you should do further reading in the general area of your long essay, do other research or writing towards the prospectus, long essay, or work on your blog entries and presentation preparation. (3-8 hours)

**Elective Reading Handout**

As described above, you must submit four reflective essays and four elective reading handouts. Sign-ups for this will be done in Week 1 and we should aim to fill all elective reading categories before doubling up on a single category. In weeks you submit an elective reading handout, you need to post this as a document to the moodle by Tuesday evening. This is to allow other students, and myself, to review the handouts before class. The handout *should not be raw notes* on the text. Compose a notes-on-notes approach which highlights key arguments, an overview of the text structure, perhaps listing some key people, events, or historiography mentioned in the text, and consider including one or more full sentence bullet points with your reflection/critique/evaluation of the work. If the elective reading consisted of multiple chapters, you must include an overview of arguments/structure of all chapters, but may optionally focus the majority of your handout on one chapter or section if you want to go into more detail. If the elective reading involves separate texts, you may focus the handout on one text.

Although you are not given an assessed mark, please note that your weekly elective reading handout is a *required* piece of work. You will *receive an academic alert* if you fail to submit the elective reading handout you have signed up for, and you may then be asked to submit a short review essay of the work for the alert to be resolved. 

- Post it as a Word, Txt, RTF, Markdown, or ODT - not PDF
- No more than two pages
- Please put the title of the text/s at the top of the handout
- Please include your name under the title

**Introducing Elective Readings and your Essay Progress to Your Classmates**

In submitting your handout you are showing your understanding of the main arguments and themes of the elective reading you chose. Use your knowledge of this reading as you contribute to the seminar discussion. Sometimes, you may be called upon in class, without warning, to tell the class a bit more about the category of elective readings that you read or answer questions about claims and arguments you have mentioned in the handout. It is therefore important that you have your broader notes organised well enough to allow you to clearly and concisely articulate the main ideas. 

You will also be asked in class to report on the progress on your long essay research in multiple weeks. Please be sure to reserve some time each week to work on your long essay and be ready to say what progress you have made on it.
