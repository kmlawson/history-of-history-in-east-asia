# Tutorial Preparation

**Reading**

This module, which has no final exam, is designed to provide you flexibility in your learning, while also providing themes that enable us to have rich seminar discussion. It is important that you come to tutorial well prepared as you will be expected to know the materials well. Your preparation for each week will require the usual 15-20 hours of work, and I suggest you **divide the preparation time across three days**. Your reading and research each week is comprised of:

1) Core readings that all students are required to read, usually around 150-200 pages (4-8 hours)
2) Additional required 'elective' reading that is selected by the student from several options provided. You must choose one category of readings to prepare and provide an elective reading handout. Usually less than 50 pages. (2-4 hours)
3) Each week you should do further reading in the general area of your long essay, do other research or writing towards the prospectus, long essay, or work on your blog entries and presentation preparation. (3-8 hours)

**Elective Reading Handout**

Each week, you should post a handout (no more than one page front and back; see above under presentation section) relating to the category of *elective readings* you have done to the class files on Teams each week by noon the day before class. This is to allow other students, and myself, to review the handouts the evening before class. The handout *should not be raw notes* on the text. Compose a notes-on-notes approach which highlights key arguments, an overview of the text structure, perhaps listing some key people, events, or historiography mentioned in the text, and consider including one or more full sentence bullet points with your reflection/critique/evaluation of the work. If the elective reading consisted of multiple chapters, you must include an overview of arguments/structure of all chapters, but may optionally focus the majority of your handout on one chapter or section if you want to go into more detail.

Use Microsoft Teams to claim particular readings for your elective reading in a first come, first serve fashion. Try to ensure all elective readings are covered before choosing one already taken, feel free to arrange switches. Since choices are fewer than students in most semesters, so we will get more than one handout. This is useful as differing interpretations of what was important, different critiques, focus on different sections, etc. will meaningfully inform the discussion. 

Although you are not given a mark for it, please note that your weekly elective reading handout is a *required* piece of work. You will receive an academic alert if you fail to submit the elective reading handout by noon the day before class, and you may then be asked to submit a short review essay of the work for the alert to be resolved. *Note:* It is perfectly fine if your blog entries are written about the same text or texts that your chosen elective reading and handout are about. 

**Introducing Elective Readings and your Essay Progress to Your Classmates**

In submitting your handout you are showing your understanding of the main arguments and themes of the elective reading you chose. Use your knowledge of this reading as you contribute to the seminar discussion. Sometimes, you may be called upon in class, without warning, to tell the class a bit more about the category of elective readings that you read or answer questions about claims and arguments you have mentioned in the handout. It is therefore important that you have your broader notes organised well enough to allow you to clearly and concisely articulate the main ideas. 

You will also be asked in class to report on the progress on your long essay research in multiple weeks. Please be sure to reserve some time each week to work on your long essay and be ready to say what progress you have made on it.
