# Changes

Here I list some of the significant changes in this module over the years, after the module was first offered fall of 2020.

## 2022 Fall

Shift from blog to reflective essay posts on Moodle. Moved submission earlier for this assessment.

## 2020 Fall

First run of the module. The reading selection is in part determined by the necessity of readings being available online through our library due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The readings for the first year are not all ideal, and future years will need careful reevaluation of the weekly reading.
